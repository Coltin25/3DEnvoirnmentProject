I approach designing software by assessing the client's needs first then starting with a rough layout of how I think every large object should be placed. I then refine the structures and create details such as textures, small items, and lighting of objects. 
After assessing each area with each new phase I paid attention to detail and work towards making each area as efficient as possible. Utilizing my skills ive learned from my computer science courses I can continue to improve my work and become better than before.
